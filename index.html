        <span class="default-text">A Representation-Theoretic Approach to Musical Transformations on the Chromatic Scale</span>
        <span class="hover-text">This study explores the intersection of abstract algebra and music theory through the lens of representation theory. Specifically, it investigates how cyclic and dihedral groups—commonly used to model transpositions and inversions in Western music—can be represented as linear transformations acting on vector spaces constructed from the twelve-tone chromatic scale. By assigning matrix representations to group elements, we provide a formal mathematical framework for analyzing musical transformations, such as chord progressions and key modulations. Sample applications on pitch-class sets and triads illustrate how the algebraic structure of music can be visualized and quantified, offering potential insights for computational music analysis and music theory pedagogy.</span>

    <a href="Papers/supplementary.html" class="text-swap no-style-link"><div class="column">
        <span class="default-text">A supplementary learning material in Pre-Calculus for incoming Undergraduate Student</span>
        <span class="hover-text">A learning resource designed to support undergraduate students in mastering Pre-Calculus concepts. This material includes concise explanations, visual aids, and practice problems that reinforce foundational topics such as functions, equations, inequalities, and trigonometry. Tailored to align with the standard college-level curriculum, it serves as a bridge for students transitioning into more advanced mathematics, providing both theoretical insight and problem-solving strategies. Ideal for review, self-study, or use alongside classroom instruction.</span>

        <span class="default-text">Modeling Academic Performance: A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of High School Students' GPA</span>
        <span class="hover-text">Academic performance is a critical measure of student performance and a key indicator of educational system effectiveness. This study employs multiple linear regression (MLR) to explore the influence of demographic characteristics, study habits, parental involvement, and participation in extracurricular activities on the Grade Point Averages (GPA) of two thousand, three hundred ninety-two (2,392) high school students aged 15-18.</span>

        <span class="default-text">A Systematic Review of Arduino-based Projects on Aquaculture in the Philippines</span>
        <span class="hover-text">The scope of this study is to give a summary of literature about how Arduinobased projects are used in aquaculture in the Philippines. The only probable limitation of the study is the inaccuracy of results. Setting where the study was conducted, demographics of the participants, maintenance of the devices, and other elements may not be provided in each study (Dahabreh, 2012). This may result in a vague conclusion of results, making the review inaccurate.</span>

Ang resulta ng pananaliksik ay makatutulong rin sa pagtukoy ng epekto ng computer games sa mental health ng mga iskolar na maaaring magamit bilang basehan ng mga mananaliksik para sa kanilang pananaliksik sa hinaharap. Makikinabang din ang mga iskolar sapagkat ang impormasyon makukuha ay tuluyan makaaapekto sa kanila upang maagapan o mapabuti ang mga umiiral na isyu sa kalusugan ng isip</span>

        <span class="default-text">Effects of PSHS-EVC Grade 11 Students' Homework to Academic Performance Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic</span>
        <span class="hover-text">The purpose of this study is to find and analyze the effects of homework on the academic performance of students. Questions like how many and how frequent the and homework is being given, the time and effort students exert to finish their homework, and how close the relationship between this effort and academic performance is will be answered by the results of the study. To do this, the researchers will have selected students answer a set of questions about homework. Data obtained from the questionnaire will then be analyzed to get the final result. It shows that the results are aggregated with very few outliers. Respondents have almost the same habits and perceptions in regard to their homework.</span>
